We've been through a few iterations on the logo design and can finally reveal
the new ployst logo!

We asked [skydesigner][skydesigner] at
[fiverr.com][fiverr] to produce the logo and after explaining our concept
to them we feel that it captures some of the key principles of ployst.

## Logo

 - Focused

   One of the aims of ployst is to enable more focused periods at work. The
   sharp orange chosen for the logo represents that focus.

 - Transparent

   Ployst is aimed at enabling companies that want to be internally
   transparent. The open gap to the bottom of the speech bubble represents
   openness for the organization.

 - Actionable

   One of the tag lines for ployst is 'Turn conversation into action'. The
   lightning bolt inside the speech bubble represents this.

 - Curated

   Ployst conversations can be rearranged, shared, muted and more.
   Communication under your control. It is arguable whether the clean font and
   independent lettering portray these ideas.


## Logo making process

We looked at [fiverr.com][fiverr] following a recommendation. After
comparing the features and prices with [99designs.com][99designs] we decided
to go for the cheaper option (at about 1/10th of the price).

For $36.75 we got 5 iterations on a logo design from [skydesigner][skydesigner]
with each iteration having a turnaround time of around 1-2 days.

We're happy with the results!
